# Nintendo-TVii-Web
An revival of the Nintendo TVii app, by recreating the original UI and then implement actual JavaScript for the AJAX logic
# Why are you doing this?
I wanted to revive this app, i feel im the only one that sees the true potential...
# Do you have any help?
Still searching for a server, but rv3 was helpful by creating a community for debugging Miiverse posting
# Is Pretendo related?
No, but i still hope they accept me as part of their 3rd party servers
