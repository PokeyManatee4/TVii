Thanks!
# Why did you archive this?
I decided to move on from the Wii/Wii U community, also, i will still be using it, i am just not going to be on any outside activity, like Discord, etc.
# Do you have any mental help?
No, not really.
# Can i use it and give it a shot?
Yeah!, anyone can use this code and do whatever with it, pull requests and issues will be obviously ignored, i dont really care if you credit it or not, its archived for a reason, i dont want to do a license, again, do what you want, just want to remind you that the JavaScript and CSS might look very messy, and i had to use placeholders for the URLs (like Miiverse URLs) since i never got to make the server API, or get any routes set up.
# Where can i find you?
I am not certain in the new community to go, but ive been learning animation and been really interested on it, soooo........
